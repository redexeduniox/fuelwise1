    steps:
      # 1. Check out your repository
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Set up JDK 17
      - name: Set up JDK 17
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          distribution: 'temurin'
          java-version: '17'

      # 3. Set up the Flutter SDK
      - name: Set up Flutter
        uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2
        with:
          channel: 'stable'

      # 4. Install Flutter dependencies
      - name: Install Flutter dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      # 5. Decode the Keystore and create key.properties
      - name: Decode Keystore
        run: |
          # Create key.properties in the android/ folder
          # This file tells the build to look for 'my-upload-key.jks'
          echo "storeFile=my-upload-key.jks" > android/key.properties
          echo "keyAlias=${{ secrets.KEY_ALIAS }}" >> android/key.properties
          echo "keyPassword=${{ secrets.KEY_PASSWORD }}" >> android/key.properties
          echo "storePassword=${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_PASSWORD }}" >> android/key.properties

          # THIS IS THE FIX:
          # Decode the .jks file into the 'android/app/' folder
          # This is where the build.gradle file is looking for it
          echo "${{ secrets.KEYSTORE_BASE64 }}" | base64 --decode > android/app/my-upload-key.jks

      # 6. Build the signed APK
      - name: Build Signed APK
        run: flutter build apk --release

      # 7. Upload the APK as a workflow artifact
      - name: Upload APK artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: release-apk
          path: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
